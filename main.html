                The history of the Order of the Knights Templar, to which we are heirs, dates
                back more than several centuries. Initially, the Order of the Poor Knights of
                the Temple of Solomon comprised of nine brave knights, who as their goal
                set the protection of Christian pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land. As
                the years go by, the Order became the first and strongest charity institution
                in Christendom, saving hundreds of thousands of lives.
            </p>
            <p class="lang-second__p">
                However, the knight brothers were falsely accused and extinguished by the
                enviers of the Order, the tyrants who ruined a grand action. Today, when
                the world is mired in lies, world governments and the church are trading
                conscience and use religion and power for personal gain, we adhere to
                true spiritual ideals -, i.e., justice and honor, supporting and protecting
                those afflicted and oppressed. Our motto is – «Non nobis, Domine,
                non nobis, set tuo nomini da gloriam!»
            </p>
            <p class="lang-third__p">
                In this time of trouble, we stand for a new order grounded in the old principles
                of faith in one God, our Father. We are set for exiling from the temples of the
                greedy false priests who gain profit from human sorrows, and rejecting the
                anger and depravity that reigns around!
            </p>
            <p class="lang-fourth__p">
                Remember, it is time for salvation of your souls, as well as the souls of your
                children and your loved ones. Let everyone make their own contribution to
                the revival of the Order of the Poor Knights. Together we will get stronger,
                we will rise in the former greatness; and peace and prosperity will reign
                when people find freedom and well-being. Hear us out, because the soldiers
                of Christ are poor in material meaning only, though they are abundant
                spiritually, and are ready to uphold their ideals and principles: true faith,
                honor and justice!
